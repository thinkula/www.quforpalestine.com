            <h2>STATEMENT OF SUPPORT & DEMANDING DIVESTMENT</h2>
            <p>To Judy Olian,</p>
            <p>We are a group of Quinnipiac alumni who write to you our concerns with the University's handling of the ongoing genocide in Gaza. We are concerned about the University's attempts to normalize occupation and settler colonialism through academic discourse, as well as the University's complicity in the occupation and genocide in Palestine. We call on you and university leadership to do the following:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>CONDEMN</strong> the killing of over 42,000 Palestinians from October 7 to today;</li>
                <li><strong>PROTECT</strong> students, faculty, and organizations advocating for Palestinian human rights and Palestinian self-actualization;</li>
                <li><strong>DIVEST</strong> from companies and institutions actively committing genocide in Palestine;</li>
                <li><strong>ADHERE</strong> to the mission that the Albert Schweitzer Institute claims to uphold in dismantling settler colonialism;</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We cannot allow our compassion to be conditional; while university admin continue to push dialogue between the oppressor and the oppressed, we cannot minimize what the Palestinians are going through. It has been more than 200 days since the genocide in Gaza began, and Quinnipiac has only centered Israeli and Zionist voices.</p>
            <p>It is imperative that you and the Quinnipiac administration understand that our grievances are not with the greater Quinnipiac community, but with the university's policy and complicity in genocide instead.</p>
            <p>We ask that Quinnipiac University upholds its mission to build an ambitious, inclusive and innovative future dedicated to creating enlightened global citizens equipped for the challenges and opportunities of 21st-century careers.</p>
