                <p>We are a group of Quinnipiac alumni actively committed to the cause of Palestinian liberation and dismantling Zionism.</p>
                
                <p>We demand that Quinnipiac University be transparent in its investments and divest from the state of Israel. Israel is committing genocide against the Palestinian people, and we do not want alum donations or any other university funds going toward killing innocent civilians.</p>
                
                <p>Quinnipiac Alumni for Palestine is a platform for staff, students, alumni, faculty, and the wider community to advocate for Palestinian rights, raise awareness, and support initiatives promoting justice and equality.</p>
                
                <p>Judaism exists beyond Zionism, and we encourage you to understand the history before October 7, particularly from our fellow activists, Jewish Voice for Peace, and its various chapters. Knowledge is power, and as alumni of Quinnipiac University, we are working on organizing events and providing educational resources to support the Palestinian community.</p>
                
                <p>We want peace, above all else, particularly when we are taught by the Albert Schweitzer Institute to “become agents in promoting a culture of peace in our communities and the wider world.”</p>
